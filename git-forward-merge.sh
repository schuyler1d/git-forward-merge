# This command was written in order to solve an annoyance with the built-in `git
# merge`. The annoying thing about `git merge` is that if one wants to merge
# branch `foo` into branch `bar`, one first needs to check out branch `bar`, and
# only then merge `foo` into it. This can become a drag, especially when having
# an unclean working tree.

# Enter `git forward-merge`. All pushes done with it work regardless of which
# branch is currently checked out and which files are in the working tree.

# Push branch `foo` into `bar`:

#     git forward-merge foo bar
    
# Push current branch/commit into `bar`:

#     git forward-merge bar

# How does it work?
# -----------------

# `git forward-merge` creates a temporary git index file and working directory to
# be used only for the merge, without interfering with the actual index file and
# working directory. (Unless the merge is a fast-forward, in which case the merge
# is done trivially by a local push.)


# Limitation
# ----------

# `git forward-merge` works only when the merge can be done
# automatically. It doesn't work for merges that require conflict resolution. For
# that, please resort to using `git merge`.

# If you do attempt a merge that requires conflict resolution, `git
# forward-merge` will abort the merge and leave your working directory clean,
# UNLESS the branch you're merging to is the current branch, in which case it
# will leave the merge in the working directory for you to resolve the conflict
# and commit, just like `git merge`.

# Future TODOs
# maybe have a switch so that if there is a conflict you would keep the dir
# and then have another switch to say 'use this dir for the conflict resolutions'
